# PokeDeX

A program that uses express.js and integrates a Pokemon API

## Project Structure
- `pokemon-application`: Server application that utilizes Express.js Router.
- `pokemon-api`: Local module that acts as a custom Pokemon API client, extending the functionality of [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexhalcazar/PokeDex

```

2. Install Dependencies for the entire project:
